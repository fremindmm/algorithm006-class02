I just want to practice my skills of describing technical things in English

Before learning the lecture, I have already finished around 150+ quizes in Leetcode, but most of them are on the level of easy or medium. However, after the first week training, i tried to challenge some hard questions such as "41. First Missing Positive" by following the tips from the teacher and found more confidence. 

In the processing of solving question 41, firstly, I got the idea of using a fixed array whose length is the maximum number in the input array, which should be a working solution basicly, but it can not pass the test case when the input array is [MAX_INTEGER]. In the following, I read the offical answer and got the inspiration that it is enough to build the fixed array as the length of the input array. Finally, I addressed the case and it's even briefer than the offical one. For more details, you can check the code. Looking forward to any suggestions
