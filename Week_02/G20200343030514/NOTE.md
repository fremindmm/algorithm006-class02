学习笔记
Honestly, the 22nd question of 'generate-parentheses' in leetcode is a good sample case to understand recursion, which includes the typical steps for addressing similar questions. Based on it, I solved question 46 & 47 independently and some details in the implementations are even better than the offcial answers. Cheers!
